       <div class="st1">In November, 2007, our company installed a Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valve with a bore of DN 2000mm produced by Hunan Bonanza Valve Co. LTD in the flap valve innovation of Shangpu pumping station. After two months' practical application, the unfolded angle of Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valve can reach 90 degrees and the flux of water pump is obviously greater than the old one. This kind of Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valve is really a novel-designed, energy-saving, safe and reliable product. </div>

</div>
       <div class="st1">Our company installed two Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valves with a bore of DN 1600mm produced by Hunan Bonanza Valve CO. LTD in Jinxia Sewage Treatment Plant of Kaifu district in October, 2007. These two flap valves were mainly used in the sewerage outfall on the riverbank. After three months' application, it achieved a sound effect. Once there was water in the pipeline, the flap valves could automatically open. The more the water was, the greater the angle was, with a degree of 90 as the greatest angle. When the water pressure of outer river is greater than the one of inner river, the flap valve can automatically close without any on-and-off equipment or manual operation.</div>

       <div class="st1">Yingtan's Embankment Project on the Western Tong River altogether installed 6 pieces of Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valves produced by Hunan Bonanza Valve CO. LTD, DN700 and DN800 each one piece, DN1200 and DN1400 each two pieces. All of these were used for sewage automatic-disposal.
The 6 pieces had a very sound effect after being thrown into application. Before the flood season, when the fluid's pressure inside the pipeline was greater than the pressure of flap valve, the flap valve could open automatically. During the flood season, when the river water level was beyond the highest water level inside the culvert, the flap valve could close automatically, with no need of on-and-off equipment or manual operation.

</div>
       <div class="st1">This June, our station installed a BLS Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valve with a bore of DN800. After a practical operation test in the flood season, its advantages are revealed like the follows:
1. There is a low start-up load. While the machine is operating, the current load can reduce 20A and the machine operates in a stable condition.
2. Due to the large angle while operating, the drainage resistance in the pipe exit is basically eliminated so that the flow velocity and rate are largely increased while the machine is operating, thus the work efficiency is enhanced obviously. 
3. The unique and novel design can help the product open quickly but close slowly. When the machine is starting up, the flap valve can open quickly and stably operate. When the machine is off, the flap valve can close in 3 to 5 seconds with a little impact force.
4. The product has a proper structure and it is convenient to operate and keep. It works well in saving energy, consumption,time and labor, which makes it a new technological product popular with workers in the port.</div>

  1. The unique design makes the machine's flow velocity and rate larger than the old one while starting up.
  2. The electricity load while starting up is reduced by 40A. It can save 20 degrees of electricity compared with the old one per hour and operate in a stable condition. 
  3. The machine can normally operate in pressure tank and close with a little compact force. It is stable and safe.
  4. With novel design, unique movement track, simple yet proper structure and convenience of installing and maintenance, this new energy-saving machine is well worthy of being widely promoted in Electromechanical Irrigation and Drainage Station.

<div>2. Energy-saving  Side Automatic Devices for Anti-reflux<br />2.1 Energy-saving Side Automatic Devices for  Anti-reflux is proprietary product with a patent owned by Hunan Bonanza Valve  Co. LTD. The first generation of this product was called &quot;Energy-saving  Valve for Flood Storage in Irrigation and Drainage &quot; and the second  generation was called &quot;Free Energy-saving Rollover-type Flap Valve&quot;.  Energy-saving Side Automatic Devices for Anti-reflux is the third generation  and it consists of the following two kinds:</div>

  2.2 Working  principle <br />
    Based on principle of mechanics, if you  vertically lay the door axis and tilts it to a certain angle, you can open or  close the flap valve with the pressure difference between the fluid's entering  and exit. When the fluid's pressure inside the pipeline is greater than the  pressure of flap valve outside the pipeline, the flap valve will automatically  open. Otherwise, the flap valve will automatically close and there is no need  of gas liquid control or manual control.¬† <br />
    2.3  Characteristics of Energy-saving Side Automatic Devices for Anti-reflux<br />
    2.3.1  No on-and-off device. Automatic on and off.<br />
    2.3.2  Safe and stable, energy-saving and efficient. The installation effectiveness is  73% and it can save about 22.5% electricity. <br />
    2.3.3  Convenient to maintain and long operational life span.<br />
    2.4 Range of Application<br />
    It is mainly used for flood storage, city  self-drainage and inter basin water transfer.
